		<content>-- RECEIVING GALAXY-WIDE TRANSMISSION -- | This just in: an alliance of major urbworlds have recently suspended their educational campaign involving repeatedly exposing small children to horror films to "toughen them up." | This has been confirmed to have resulted in a massive decrease in the severity and prevalence of anxiety across known space. | -- TRANSMISSION ENDS--</content>

		<content>-- RECEIVING GALAXY-WIDE TRANSMISSION -- | A number of colonists on distant rimworlds have complained about their doors being locked open seemingly at random. Many assumed this was a fault in the door mechanism, and sought to repair them. | However, it appears that the doors were intentionally left open by malefactors. In response to the great annoyance of other colonists who were not expecting this behavior, they have agreed to stop sabotaging bases unless the option is enabled under Options -> Mod Settings. | -- TRANSMISSION ENDS--</content>

		<content>-- RECEIVING GALAXY-WIDE TRANSMISSION -- | A human behavior research team has just published a study showing that people are more receptive to arrest when the officer has high Social skill. | In other news, a shocking new psychological treatment for Pyromaniacs has become available to the general public. It involves initial diagnosis and therapy followed by a medical regimen. | Experts on the human psyche have announced the existence of 8 mental breaks not previously acknowledged: Sadism, Self-harm, Tantrum, Abuse, Compulsion, Antisocial, Apathy, and Histrionic. They say a person's traits may have an effect on some of these breaks. | -- TRANSMISSION ENDS--</content>

		<content>-- RECEIVING GALAXY-WIDE TRANSMISSION -- | HAPPY 10,000 SUBSCRIBERS! | Glitterworld scientists have put in hundreds of hours of work to come up with a discovery worthy of this milestone. At long last, their efforts have come to a culmination, and this new information may change how you see the rimworld forever. | It has been discovered that everyone in the universe has a hitherto-unknown "psyche" that contains insight as to their personality and sexuality. Dr. Sigmond Fraud, galaxy-renowned psychologist, has painstakingly created a metric by which they can be judged, and colony overseers will have access to this information immediately. | The news of this revelation has sent shockwaves throughout known spaces, and your colonists may behave aberrantly for a short while until they adjust to this new perception of themselves and each other. It's for the better. | In other news, democracy has come to the rimworlds! Colonies across the rim have begun to hold elections for mayor, and now that colonists actually know a bit about themselves, they can put forth and vote on convincing and interesting platforms for candidacy. Elections are held in the fall after a colony's first year. | Mayors will receive visits from their constiuents, particularly if they are especially upset or happy. Complaining to the mayor will likely make a colonist feel better, and the mayor will be affected by all visits from their constituents. | And finally, this revolutionary understanding of human psychology has allowed bold new treatments for drug addiction and depression to hit medical books. Colonists may be treated by a doctor with high enough Social and Medicine skill to be given a prescription that will mitigate their problems. | For colonists who are already addicted, methadone is available through trading or crafting to suppress withdrawal symptoms. | It's a whole new world out there, and we're excited to share it with you. More details are available on the mod page. | -- TRANSMISSION ENDS--</content>

		<content>-- RECEIVING GALAXY-WIDE TRANSMISSION -- | Reports have been trickling in about errors in colony equipment when attempting to process colonists who did not properly fill out their psyche and sexuality paperwork. | This almost exclusively affected colony overseers who had encounters with humanoid aliens, and those who subscribed to the notion of diversified romance. | These errors could potentially be dire, and even crash the offending machines entirely. Macrosoftware Inc. has apologized for this glitch, and issued a recall that will replace broken machines with new ones that are capable of fixing the error, but reminds users that this is not intended behavior and ultimately they take risk into their own hands when they choose to run their machines under conditions they weren't designed for. | Colony overseers should now be able to load the saved files that previously caused problems. | -- TRANSMISSION ENDS--</content>

		<content>-- RECEIVING GALAXY-WIDE TRANSMISSION -- | It's a common complaint among colonists on distant rimworlds that work comes thick and fast, and aside from the occasional party, residents rarely get the time to get to know anyone that they don't spend their day alongside. | That's why some colonists have begun to adopt a practice known colloquially as "hanging out." Particularly in larger colonies with more free time to go around, colonists not explicitly assigned to work will arrange to spend time relaxing with other colonists that they would otherwise remain acquaintances with. | This new form of social interaction has spread to the romantic world as well, with some couples regularly arranging "dates," little more than an intimate version of hanging out, to keep their relationship alive. | While these budding social interactions are often canceled by their participants being drafted to fight the colony's latest threat, this undoubtedly represents a meaningful shift in how colonists on rimworlds get to know each other. | This has been Patricia Urist, bringing you this special report. Now back to the news. | -- TRANSMISSION ENDS--</content>

		<content>-- RECEIVING GALAXY-WIDE TRANSMISSION -- | We interrupt this broadcast to bring you breaking news. It appears that Macrosoftware Inc. has released a new version of their colony paperwork processing software, Excellence. Where previously the psyche and sexuality paperwork for a colonist could not be modified once entered into the program, Macrosoftware Inc. has now added support for correcting mistakes through its "Dev Mode." | Additionally, colony managers who prefer to prepare carefully for their journeys to the rimworlds can now use the software to be more selective in who they bring along, allowing for finer control of the psyche profiles of accepted applicants. | Now back to the news. Are you tired of feeling unnatural compulsions to talk to people, when all you want to do is lie in bed? Does the office jerk seem to get everyone's attention, even though no one likes him? You may both be the victims of a newly-discovered brain parasite, which scientists have... | -- TRANSMISSION ENDS--</content>

		<content>-- RECEIVING GALAXY-WIDE TRANSMISSION -- | HAPPY 30,000 SUBSCRIBERS! | Thank you to all of you who have tuned in to this frequency. Your support means a lot, and it is a pleasure to have brought you a more realistic, enjoyable, and engaging view of life on the Rim for almost a year now. It wouldn't be possible without your encouragement. | Now for the news: Funerals are a long and storied tradition in human history, but until recently, very few were ever held on the rimworlds. No more, as this lost art seems to have been rediscovered, and the practice is now being reported widely across the edges of the known galaxy. | Colony managers who make use of the 'MAI' system will be pleased to learn that the hardware bug which prevented them from booting up has been remedied and colonists should be able to boot up future models. On the other hand, the skin-eating parasites which... | -- TRANSMISSION ENDS--</content>

An office can be created in any room which has a table in it by selecting it and designating the room as a mayoral office. Mayors will hold their meetings in their office if possible. | -- TRANSMISSION ENDS--</content>
